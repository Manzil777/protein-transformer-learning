# Security Assessment Report
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** ✅ Low Risk

## 1. Executive Summary
The application code structure is fundamentally secure. Configuration best practices are followed (env vars, gitignore). One low-severity frontend dependency issue was identified and remediated.

## 2. Findings

### A. Dependencies
- **Frontend (`npm`)**: Initially found 1 low-severity vulnerability in `qs` (DoS vector).
  - **Status**: Remediated via `npm audit fix`.
- **Backend (`pip`)**: No critical vulnerabilities identified in core packages (`flask`, `transformers`, `google-genai`).

### B. Configuration
- **Secrets**: API keys are NOT hardcoded. `.env` is properly excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **Debug Mode**: `FLASK_DEBUG` is controlled via environment variables, defaulting to `false` (Production-safe defaults).
- **CORS**: Restricted to `http://localhost:5173` by default, preventing arbitrary cross-origin requests.

### C. Code Logic
- **Input Validation**:
  - Backend: `validate_sequence` enforces length limits and character sets (A-Z only).
  - Backend: Regex usage is simple and non-recursive, minimizing ReDoS risk.
- **XSS Prevention**: Frontend uses React's default escaping. No instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` found in user input paths.

## 3. Recommendations
1.  **Regular Audits**: Run `npm audit` and `pip-audit` locally before every major release.
2.  **API Rate Limiting**: The backend implements basic per-IP rate limiting (`RateLimiter` class), which is good for MVP. For production, consider Redis-based limiting.
3.  **HTTPS**: Ensure the deployed application runs behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Cloudflare) enforcing HTTPS.
